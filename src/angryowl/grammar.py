class Grammar:
    '''
    A grammar is represented by 4 variables:

    :param VN: list of nonterminals (strings)
    :param VT: list of terminals (strings)
    :param P: list of productions represented by a dictionary, where
        keys are rules and values are sets of rules.
        A rule is a tuple of terminals and nonterminals.
        Although, a rule can also be represented by a string
        if every symbol is a single character in length.
    :param S: starting state (string)

    For example, the formal grammar::

        A -> aA
        A -> aB
        A -> Îµ
        B -> b

    Is represented by the following variables::

        VN = {"A", "B"}
        VT = {"a", "b"}
        P = {
            ("A",): {("a", "B"), ("a", "A"), ()},
            ("B",): {("b",)}
        }
        S = "A"
